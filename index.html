          <h1>Game of Thrones Board Game</h1>
            <p>It's been 10 years since the Burning of King's Landing. Queen Cersei (*add image here*) was presumed dead. Queen Daenerys lived, she and King Ageon (formerly Jon Snow, *add image here*) Targaryan of Crown House Targaryan, now rule the 6 kingdoms. Winterfell is independent of the crown, and is ruled by the Queen in the North, Sansa Stark of House Stark. Almost all houses have been re-established, all except house Frey. The Twins are home to an Inn for wary travelers.</p> <br>
            <p>Since that fateful day, Queen Daenerys's actions have been questionable. She is cruel, unjust and paranoid. Someome must stop her. I, Gendry Storm (formerly, Rivers) of House Baratheon will rise against her. I am embarking on a journey to obtain support for my cause, will you help me? </p>

          <h1>Game Instructions</h1>
            <p>The game is a simple one, you must guide Gendry through Westeros's great houses. He must obtain their support, loyalty <br>... and gold.</p> 
            <p>Use each house's sigil to guide you through the game, always moving to the left. Be wary of King's Landing for the queen must not find out - or she'll have his head!</p><br>
            <p>While visiting each house, you must make desicions the lords and ladies will find favorable. This will gain you points. When you've reached more than 400 points - you are ready to move against the Queen. Be wary of liars, everyone has their own agenda.</p><br>
            <p>Leaderboard will contain points obtained from Barathon pledged houses, they have given their support! For the true King.</p>
